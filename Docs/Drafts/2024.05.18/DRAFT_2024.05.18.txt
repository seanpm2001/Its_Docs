Its statement

Purpose of an its statement

shortened form of it is statement
Equivalent to ===
If followed by a period, it can end a loop or statement (in Python)

def sequence1():
    x = int(2)
    x = x + 1
    while (x < 42):
        print(x)
        if (its x > 2):
            throw error
        elif
            its.
    else:
        print("Announcer: its...")
        its.

This is pretty bad code. I just wanted to use the Monty Python character 'It's man' in some unique way, as Python is full of Monty Python references, and Its man is one of my favorite characters. I can rework this definition if needed.
